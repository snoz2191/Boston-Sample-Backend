The application for Boston needs web services for several modules. At the moment the Task Module is in development process 

### Instructions ###

* First, we need to set up the virtual environment

mkvirtualenv Boston
workon Boston
```

* Install all the requirements
```
#!python

pip install
```

** Note: To deactivate a virtualenv just type in the following command:
```
#!python
deactivate
```

And to work on a virtualenv that has been already deactivated, just type in the following command:
